## Image Blurring (Image Smoothing)
### Image blurring is achieved by convolving the image with a low-pass filter kernel. It is useful for removing noise. It actually removes high frequency content (e.g: noise, edges) from the image resulting in edges being blurred when this is filter is applied. (Well, there are blurring techniques which do not blur edges). OpenCV provides mainly four types of blurring techniques.

### 1. Averaging
### This is done by convolving the image with a normalized box filter. It simply takes the average of all the pixels under kernel area and replaces the central element with this average. This is done by the function cv2.blur() or cv2.boxFilter(). Check the docs for more details about the kernel. We should specify the width and height of kernel. A 3x3 normalized box filter would look like this:

### 2. Gaussian Filtering
### In this approach, instead of a box filter consisting of equal filter coefficients, a Gaussian kernel is used. It is done with the function, cv2.GaussianBlur(). We should specify the width and height of the kernel which should be positive and odd. We also should specify the standard deviation in the X and Y directions, sigmaX and sigmaY respectively. If only sigmaX is specified, sigmaY is taken as equal to sigmaX. If both are given as zeros, they are calculated from the kernel size. Gaussian filtering is highly effective in removing Gaussian noise from the image.
### If you want, you can create a Gaussian kernel with the function, cv2.getGaussianKernel().

### 3. Median Filtering
### Here, the function cv2.medianBlur() computes the median of all the pixels under the kernel window and the central pixel is replaced with this median value. This is highly effective in removing salt-and-pepper noise. One interesting thing to note is that, in the Gaussian and box filters, the filtered value for the central element can be a value which may not exist in the original image. However this is not the case in median filtering, since the central element is always replaced by some pixel value in the image. This reduces the noise effectively. The kernel size must be a positive odd integer.
