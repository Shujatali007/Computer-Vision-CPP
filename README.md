# What is openCV?

### OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. In ### simple language it is library used for Image Processing. It is mainly used to do all the operation related to Images.

## What it can do : 
      1. Read and Write Images.

      2. Detection of faces and its features.

      3. Detection of shapes like Circle,rectangle etc in a image. E.g Detection of coin in images.

      4. Text recognition in images. e.g Reading Number Plates/

      5. Modifying image quality and colors e.g Instagram, CamScanner.

      6. Developing Augmented reality apps.

     and many more.....

## Which Language it supports :     

      1. C++

      2. Android SDK

      3. Java

      4. Python

      5. C (Not recommended)

## Some Advantages of using OpenCV :

   1. Simple to learn,lots of tutorial available.

   2. Works with almost all the famous languages.

   3. Free to use.
   
   
   
   
# Note when trying to open .ipynb file if some issue occur i:e"Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when viewing *.ipynb"
## Follow the following Steps
### 1.Copy the Url  of Program  "https://github.com/shujatalikhan/Deep_Neural_Network_Learning_Projects/blob/master/Transfer_Learning_VGG16/Convolutional_Neural_Network.ipynb" ---This is one example you can do same for any file
### 2. open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/" and Paste the Url 
### 3. Then You can See the Code
